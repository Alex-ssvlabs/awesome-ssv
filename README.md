### Tools

#### SDK
- [SSV SDK](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-sdk) `GPL | TS`
- [SSV Subgraph](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-subgraph) `TS` - Mention the docs + deployment link

#### Validator key splitting (key shares creation)

To use the SSV network a validator key needs to be split into keyshares, which then needs to be encrypted for chosen operators. You can use these tools for it, and to know more read the [documentation](https://docs.ssv.network/developers/tools/ssv-key-distributor).

- [SSV Keys - validator key splitting tool by SSV Labs](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-keys) `GPL | TS`

#### Distributed (validator) Key Generation

DKG technology unlocks trustless staking use cases and removes the necessity for a single party to hold & safeguard and split the full validator key. You can read more about [how DKG works here](https://docs.ssv.network/developers/tools/ssv-dkg-client/).

- [DKG by SSV Labs](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv-dkg) `GPL | Go` - primary DKG tool, used across SSV network
- [DKG by Randamu](https://github.com/randa-mu/ssv-dkg) `MIT | Go` - the project is in active development

#### SSV Node clients

- [SSV Node by SSV Labs](https://github.com/ssvlabs/ssv) `GPL | Go`
- [SSV Node by Sigma Prime](https://github.com/sigp/anchor) `Apache | Rust`

### Showcase Projects

- [FRENS](https://github.com/frens-pool) PING THEIR TEAM TO ASK FOR CODE SNIPPETS
Community taking pools for peer-to-peer staking on trusted node operators, stake represented by NFTs.

- [MonitorSSV](https://github.com/monitorssv/monitorssv) `MIT | Go/JS`
- [Verify Keyshares](https://github.com/RaekwonIII/verify-keyshares) `TS`
- [Cluster Balance Tool](https://github.com/taylorferran/cluster-balance-tool) `JS`
- [bApp example](https://github.com/ssvlabs/examples) `GPL | TS`
