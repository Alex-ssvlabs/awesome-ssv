# LSD staking pool powered by SSV

This repo showcases a minimalistic backend for an LSD staking pool. It is for learning purposes ONLY and should NOT be a

base for any solution used in production. It contains backend scripts and smart contracts to manage and stake Ether,

minting an LSD token (ssvETH) and leveraging ssv.network to stake in a distributed and decentralized manner.

## Credits

Huge thanks to [@RohitAudit](https://github.com/RohitAudit) whose [repo](https://github.com/RohitAudit/ssv-service)

this minimalistic staking pool is based on!

## How it works

- Staking has never been so easy, thanks to SSV, you can stake your ETH and earn ssvETH without running your own validator! ðŸ¤‘

### User Actions

- Users stake their ETH to a staking contract for which he is minted a liquid staked derivative token, ssvETH.

- Creates an Ethereum validator key and gives it to the staking pool to deposit for activation

- Generates keyshares from the validator keystore and stakes them with the SSV nodes

- Saves the keystore and keyshares for verification at a later stage

## How to deploy?

### 1. Front End plus Smart contracts - Scaffold-eth framework

If you want to deploy smart contract together with frontend using scaffold-eth framework built in `JS`continue to [RUN_SMART_CONTRACTS_AND_FRONTEND.md](/RUN_SMART_CONTRACTS_AND_FRONTEND.md).

It will navigate you through the remaining process.

## OR

### 2. Smart Contracts Only - Brownie framework

If you want to deploy smart contracts only using brownie framework built in `PY` continue to [RUN_SMART_CONTRACTS_ONLY.md](/RUN_SMART_CONTRACTS_ONLY.md).

It will navigate you through the remaining process.
