## Credits 

Great thanks goes to [@Taiga](https://twitter.com/zkTaiga) for making all the necessary changes to the original `eth-docker` stack to make the monitoring work! 
and 
[@Yorick](https://twitter.com/cryptomanuf) who has helped me with setting up nodes, `eht-docker` and staking stuff in general! 

### What will you do
The video is walking through setting up **monitoring**(SSV+EL+CL) using eth-docker prometheus and grafana.  
For more info follow the [official documentation](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/installation).

## Steps

Follow along with the video. 

	1. add new job to `/eth-docker/prometheus/custom-prom.yml` 
	2. import dasboard to grafana 
	3. edit dashboard 
		- datasource may be wrong, if so:
		find correct data source `"uid":"DSFIJO.."`
		edit dasboard
			JSON Model
				replace all datasources with correct ones 
			Variables 
				add your instance here
				you should see it in "Preview of values" field 
				
### Useful code 



```bash
 ssh user@82.999.000.000 -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 #expose_graphana_port_locally
```


```yml
  - job_name: ssv_nodes
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - lido-ssv-node:15000

  - job_name: ssv_nodes_health
    metrics_path: /health
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - lido-ssv-node:15000

```
